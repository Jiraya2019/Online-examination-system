On Day 1, the project title “Online Examination System” was clearly defined. The main objectives of the project were identified, such as conducting examinations online, reducing manual work, ensuring accuracy in evaluation, and providing quick results. The scope of the project was analyzed to understand the system boundaries, including user roles like admin, faculty, and students, along with their functionalities. A basic study of the online examination system was carried out to understand how online exams are conducted, managed, and evaluated digitally. This initial planning helped in understanding the overall workflow of the system and laid a strong foundation for the further development phases of the project.
